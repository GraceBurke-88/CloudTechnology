    <h1>Kubernetes vs Docker</h1>
<h4>Kubernetes</h4>
    <p>
        Kubernetes is a service that allows for the management of containers, usually being used after the phase of deployment of containers. Kubernetes runs single or clusters of containers by labeling them based on important attributes, inside pods. Each pod is connected to the actual network system, and the rest of the Kubernetes system by Kubernetes. Some features like Kubernetes’ replication controllers manage the creation of these pods and their deployments. In it there are pod templates which allow for any number of pods to be created within the system's ability. These templates also allow Kubernetes to scale the pod in whichever way is desired by the user. Other features, like Kubernetes service discovery, allow pods and other applications to find and interact with each other. Storage for containers is found in the volume feature, where they are backed by local storage, or other storage back ends. Features like namespaces are grouping mechanisms for clusters, wherein other aforementioned features can run simultaneously and seamlessly, while providing a level of privacy. The fact Kubernetes supports immutability between pods and clusters allows for the facility of removing different structures without disturbing others.

    </p>

    <p>
        One of the many benefits of Kubernetes is the fact that it provides the user with features to edit their software that would be difficult to replicate without it, making it easier for development of the program or application to progress. Kubernetes is also an open source tool, and therefore is constantly being worked on by many to improve it, fix bugs, and add features to facilitate its use. Kubernetes is, furthermore, a relatively new tool that is compatible with advanced technology like the Cloud, making it attractive to developers to master, as it is one of the most used containerization managing platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, this service has drawbacks like any others. It is fairly hard to master for those not familiar with it, and introducing it into a team can be a slow process, which of course, isn’t good for productivity. Its employment in simpler tasks can also result in inefficiency of task completion, as it can be too complex for smaller scaled projects.
    </p>

    <h4>Docker</h4>

    <p>
        Docker, on the other hand, creates an isolated containerized environment for applications to run on instead of focusing on the managing aspect of them. This layer of isolation adds to the security of each container and, in extension, to the program. Some of its most useful features include automating the building process of application and their deployment, usually being used before and while deploying apps. Therefore while Docker focuses on creating a platform for a container to be configured and deployed, Kubernetes manages containers, and clusters of them, after deployment. For this reason, both Kubernetes and Docker are usually both used when trying to create and run a program or application.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some of the benefits of working with Docker is that it is highly compatible with most machines, and can run applications on them seamlessly, even if deployed from one machine to another. Docker is efficient with the machine's storage, and if multiple containers use the same image or file, it will only keep one copy of it, and distribute it to any container that needs it. It is also an open source technology, and therefore it receives a lot of practical updates that only serve to keep making the deployment of apps easier.     </p>

    <p>
        Some of the drawbacks to Docker include the slower speed it runs on when implemented into bare metal servers, as opposed to VM’s. Furthermore, containers in Docker run on one OS, like Microsoft, cannot be moved to a different OS and run.
    </p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
        Both of these containerization technologies are at the front of modern software development, and in many ways important to the future of technology. While both Docker and Kubernetes have their fair share of weaknesses in their systems and use, it is important to also acknowledge the fact that these two technologies are important to learn about, and to use as they undoubtedly facilitate the creation and use of Cloud technologies- a modern frontier of technology every developer needs to get ahead of.
