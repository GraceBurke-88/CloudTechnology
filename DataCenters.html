                <h4>Explain what a data center is and how they relate to the cloud.</h4>
            A data center is the physical place where a system's most vital systems are stored, maintained, and protected. In a data center the three most important factors are HVAC, power, and IT spaces. Here, a user's information and data collected on them is stored in different servers for organization. For that reason, hardware security is a big factor in data centers.

            <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">
                <h4></h4>
            To avoid compromising hardware, most companies are strict in allocating access into their data centers, and it is impossible to enter without clearance from the company itself. Virtual security is also managed at data centers, and a team of network security experts are working around the clock to avoid hacks of any hind.

                <h4></h4>
            HVAC is important in a data center because hardware needs a certain physical environment to be able to run. Vents, fans, and AC are used to avoid a piece of hardware overheating and crashing, which would be fatal or at the very least can leave a company’s service moribund.
            Power in a data center refers to the actual amount of electricity there is in the facility to keep every piece of equipment and hardware in it on and running. Back up energy resources are managed in this area, such as emergency generators.
            <br> <br>
            Data centers are usually physical locations for storage of a specific company whereas, ‘the Cloud’ has a physical storage component to it, usually bigger Cloud data centers, whose information is accessed virtually.
            <br> <br>
            The Cloud’s physical data center can be shared by many clients, but maintained by the Cloud company, which are massive corporations like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. Clients who rent out space in these Cloud data centers can remotely access their data from their own facilities through the Internet.

                <br>In UCLA, they implemented their code into the computers, and sent themselves packets when testing communications. Surprisingly, it worked. At first the network was only used to transfer files, but soon email was created. In this, a new way of communication was born. The internet was very open to changes and ideas. People could suggest any changes they thought would be helpful, and code was soon being shared, built on, and debugged. Soon LAN and WAN networks sprouted all over the west. However, each network was a world of its own. Then, TCP IP protocol was made, which if followed by different networks, would allow them to send packets between each other. As networks implemented TCP IP, a common interconnected network was created, and as such could communicate smoothly between itself. One of the internet's next major milestones happened when congress passed a bill taking the internet out of the hands exclusively of the government, and into the mainstream. This unleashed the movement we come now to know as the internet, however, it was still hard to use, and in the 1980’s was something that needed lots of time and effort to navigate. Soon, the World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee, a browser that could connect threads of information, which really sparked the boom of the internet.
                <br>       From calculators, word processors, and spreadsheets, computers and the internet are now a source of information, a source of communication, a marketplace, and its future is never ending and vast.
