    <h1>Data Centers</h1>
<h4>Explain what a data center is and how they relate to the cloud.</h4>
    <p>
        A data center is the physical place where a system's most vital systems are stored, maintained, and protected. In a data center the three most important factors are HVAC, power, and IT spaces. Here, a user's information and data collected on them is stored in different servers for organization. For that reason, hardware security is a big factor in data centers.
    <br> <br>
        To avoid compromising hardware, most companies are strict in allocating access into their data centers, and it is impossible to enter without clearance from the company itself. Virtual security is also managed at data centers, and a team of network security experts are working around the clock to avoid hacks of any hind.
    <br> <br>
        HVAC is important in a data center because hardware needs a certain physical environment to be able to run. Vents, fans, and AC are used to avoid a piece of hardware overheating and crashing, which would be fatal or at the very least can leave a company’s service moribund.
    <br> <br>
        Power in a data center refers to the actual amount of electricity there is in the facility to keep every piece of equipment and hardware in it on and running. Back up energy resources are managed in this area, such as emergency generators.
        <br> <br>
        Data centers are usually physical locations for storage of a specific company whereas, ‘the Cloud’ has a physical storage component to it, usually bigger Cloud data centers, whose information is accessed virtually.
        <br> <br>
        The Cloud’s physical data center can be shared by many clients, but maintained by the Cloud company, which are massive corporations like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. Clients who rent out space in these Cloud data centers can remotely access their data from their own facilities through the Internet.
