    <h1>Virtualization and Containerization</h1>
    <b>What is virtualization? </b></br>
    <b>Virtualization</b> is a technology that allocates CPU, RAM, storage, and NIC’s (Network Interface Card’s) from the hardware of a host to create multiple software virtual spaces. This allows for better usage of the host’s hardware, removes the amount of hardware needed to perform a task, and facilitates the deployment of software.
    </p>
    <p>
        After introducing either Type I, ‘Bare Metal’, or Type II, ‘Hosted OS’, HyperVisor into the host’s machine, virtualization is feasible. In the case of Type I Hypervisor, it can be installed straight into the bare metal server, without anything else needed, and it can run VM’s (Virtual Machines), which can be servers, applications, or any other file. Type II HyperVisors, on the other hand, are installed into the host’s OS, and then used to create VM’s, with the same features as the ones run on Type I. </br>
        So while Type I goes : Hardware > Virtualization </br>
        Type II goes : Hardware > Host OS > Virtualization </br>
    </p>
    <p>
        After HyperVisors are installed vSwitch’s, virtual switches, are then created along with virtual machines. In these virtual machines, vNics, virtual NIC’s have to then be created, which are connected to the vSwitch, which is mapped, or connected, to the physical NIC’s of the network.
    </p>
    <p>
        So virtualization roughly, at it’s simplest, works like this : </br>
        Type I or II Hypervisor > vSwitch > VM’s (connected by) vNIC’s </br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What is containerization?</b></br>
        <b>Containerization</b>, on the other hand, is a form of virtualization that uses containers to isolate itself inside the host, where applications can run. For example in Runtime Engines, like Docker, a file, like a ‘Docker File’ will be created, which then will create an image, and lastly an actual container will be created, which holds everything needed to run the app. Some of the most famous container tech today includes Docker and Kubernetes.
    </p>
    <p>
        So the process looks roughly like: </br>
        Host OS > Runtime Engine > Containers </br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Comparison:</b></br>
        In regard to isolation level, VM’s isolate machines, or apps. VM’s don't really interact with one another, and while in one VM, we can’t really tell what is going on inside another. Containers are different, they isolate processes. Containers only see what is strictly necessary, and seemingly running on their own operating systems complete with their own libraries code, and anything else needed to run the container.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, VM’s actually use more hardware resources than containers. Each VM needs its own guest OS system running in it, alongside its binary or libraries, and the actual application. Containers only need its binary or libraries, and the application in it to run.
    </p>
    <p>
        Virtualization looks like: </br>
        Hardware > Host OS > Hypervisor > VM’s (each containing : Guest OS > Libraries/Binary > Application) </br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Containerization looks like: </br></b>br>
            Hardware > Host OS > Runtime Engine > Containers (each containing : Libraries/Binary > Application) </br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How do These Compare?</b></br>
        While virtualization deals with running multiple OS’s in a single device, containerization deals with the deployment applications in a virtual singular OS and device. In addition to this, VM’s are better to implement when working on a long term project, as containers work better with shorter projects or assignments.
    </p>
    <p>
        VM’s are easy to copy and move around, as they are not unlike any other file in a computer, multiple VM’s can be created in the hardware, within the capacity of it. Similarly, containers are able to be replicated, created, moved and deployed as long as it is within the availability of the hardware’s resources. It should be noted that it is usually feasible to create more containers in a hardware device than VM’s.
